                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, (specifically EPCC, the supercomputing part) having graduated from Queens University Belfasst in 2025 with a first class honours in Computer Science MEng. My project is supporting heterogenous architectures for ASiMoV-CCS, 
                    which is a CFD codebase developed at EPCC in collaboration with Rolls-Royce.
                    <br><br>
                    Over the past few years I have been lucky to attend the ISC HPC Conference in Hamburg in 2024 as a student volunteer, and worked as a research assistant at the Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT) at Queen's University Belfast. I have an interest in HPC, novel technologies such as FPGAs and quantum computing, as well as approaches to development (formal methods and algorithm analysis).
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of my studies, I have a huge interest in sport (every sport you can think of), and I have also been getting into my fitness, with a goal to hit a 25 minute 5KM, and sub 2 hour marathon by the end of the year (2025). I also have a wide array of other interests like reading and writing, the humanities, and movies! 
                    <br><br>
                    Tá Gaeilge agam fosta, agus is cinnte go bhfuil nios mó cleachtaidh de dhíth orm, mar sin má tá tu ag iarraidh labhairt lion, labhair in Gaeilge liom!
                    <br><br>
                    So please, take a look around my website, and if you have any questions or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me through the contact page. Also, enjoy this silly picture of me kind of dressed as Pochie from the Simpsons.
