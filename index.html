                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a computer science student currently studying at Queen's University Belfast, hoping to graduate in the coming months with an MEng. I have been accepted into a PhD role at EPCC with the University of Edinburgh, where I will be working on heterogenous computing in HPC.
                    <br><br>
                    Within the field, I have been lucky to attend the ISC HPC Conference in Hamburg in 2024 as a student volunteer, and have been working as a research assistant at the Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT) at Queen's University Belfast. I also have an interest in novel technologoies.
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of my studies, I have a huge interest in sport (every sport you can think of), and I have also been getting into my fitness, with a goal to hit a 25 minute 5KM in the next few months and to run a half marathon by the end of the year. I also have a passion for literature and have recently began writing my own poems and wanted to share them.#
                    <br><br>
                    Tá Gaeilge agam fosta, agus is cinnte go bhfuil nios mó cleachtaidh de dhíth orm, mar sin má tá tu ag iarraidh labhairt lion, labhair in Gaeilge liom!
                    <br><br>
                    So please, take a look around my website, and if you have any questions or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me through the contact page. Also, enjoy this silly picture of me kind of dressed as Pochie from the Simpsons.
